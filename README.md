# Codealpha_HangmanGame
 A simple command-line Hangman game built using Python! It allows users to choose difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) and guess letters of a randomly selected word. The game includes visual feedback with ASCII art and tracks the number of lives remaining. Words are generated using the wonderwords library.
